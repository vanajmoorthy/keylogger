# Keylogger

This is a pretty malicious keylogger I wrote just to learn Windows automation with Python. I wouldn't recommend using it on anyone but it's your life tbh. It runs as a silent background process and you can't shut it down unless you go through Task Manager so you're pretty much going to go undetected. 

## Usage
You'll have to install it on to your victim's device. 

Download the zip/clone the repo and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` (remember to download eveything in the repo).

Then just figure out how to get it on to your victim's computer and edit line 3 of ```log.pyw``` to point to a .txt file that your victim won't easily discover. 

Happy snooping.

_Disclaimer: I do not condone the malicious use of this software._
